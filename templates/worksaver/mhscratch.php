        Worksaver with over two decades of post driver innovations now offers two series
        of post drivers. Our standard duty model HPD-16 incorporates many of the
        innovations first brought to the market by Worksaver: “convertible” hydraulic valve,
        grease zerks at all major pivot locations, plated manual cranks, plastic slide blocks,
        adjustable legs, bubble level, and SplitCap™. The HPD-16 (32,000 lbs. of force) is
        ideal for the small property owner with limited fence posts to drive.
        Our Q-series of hydraulic drivers, HPD-22Q (80,000 lbs. of force) and HPD-26Q
        (110,000 lbs. of force) offer ingenious solutions to routine maintenance to
        keep the operator building fence. Q-series drivers feature two time savings
        QuickChange™ system. Worksaver’s SplitCap™ with enhanced cylinder rod design
        allows the operator to perform routine maintenance on the rod cap seal
        without removing the cylinder from the driver. Our Q-spring assembly reduces
        spring change over from hours to minutes. This design offers increased service
        life when compared to conventional post driver springs. The integrated spring/
        spring-anchor design when mounted to the cushion mounts reduces vibration
        which further provides increased spring service life. Increasing fence-building
        performance, making the Q-series a game changer.
